# MarkNotes

MarkNotes is a single `index.php` page application for viewing Markdown notes.

We used [parsedown](https://github.com/erusev/parsedown) to render Markdown file. This library 
is embedded inside the `index.php` in order to keep the goal of single page application.

To try it, run this:

	php -S localhost:3000
	open http://localhost:3000
